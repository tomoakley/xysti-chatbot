# Xysti
Xysti is an app which helps you find sports and physical activity sessions and bookable courts/pitches. You interact with it primarily through a chatbot; this repo is for Facebook Messenger but others may follow. There is a front-end app for Xysti as well.

This is built with the [Claudia Bot Builder](https://github.com/claudiajs/claudia-bot-builder/) and hosted on AWS Lambda. More to come soon!
